# ENGR2200 Final Project

The grand finale for digial systems.

# Initialization

I recommend starting in a folder of your choice (hereafter "project root") and creating a new vivado project named "final_project" inside this directory. Then go up to the parent of project root and git clone the repo. Rename the folder that is created to the same name as project root and hit "write into" or "merge folder" depending on OS.
