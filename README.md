# ENGR2200 Final Project

The grand finale for digial systems.

# Initialization

Start in a folder of your choice (hereafter "project root") and create a new vivado project named `final_project` inside this directory (make sure to use "create project subdirectory").

Go up to the parent of `project root` and git clone the repo. Rename the folder that is created to the same name as `project root` and hit "write into" or "merge folder" depending on OS.

Add Sources (alt + a) > Add or create design sources > Add Directories > `final_project/final_project.srcs` . The sources should appear in vivado's "design sources".
